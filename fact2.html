            the Mountain formations in the United States are beautiful. There are several big mountain formations in the U.S such as the rocky mountains and the appalachian mountains. The rocky mountains streach across the northwestern side of the country, and the appalachian 
            mountains streach more accross the southeast end of the country. I havent been to the appalachian mountains but i can definetly say the rocky mountains are absolutley beautiful. there are many tourist locations on various mountains. you can go cave diving,
            hiking, swiming, backpacking, and many other things on these mountains.
